			The "UNISIM Virtual Platforms" project has started several years ago within the <a class="online-document" href="http://unisim.org">UNISIM</a> simulation environment. The goals of such a simulation environment is to provide academia and industry with a simulation platform to ease hardware/software codesign including architectural exploration, but also hardware/software integration and validation.
			While the former goal get well addressed, we started to address the later, and this web site show the visible results of these works.
			However some differences exist between UNISIM and the UNISIM Virtual Platforms project: while UNISIM and its simulators are based on a fast implementation of SystemC, named FastSysC (signal coding style only, no threads), the UNISIM Virtual Platforms are based on industry standards <a class="online-document" href="http://standards.ieee.org/getieee/1666/index.html">IEEE1666<sup>TM</sup></a>, <a class="online-document" href="http://www.systemc.org/downloads/standards">OSCI SystemC<sup>TM</sup></a> and <a class="online-document" href="http://www.systemc.org/downloads/standards">OSCI SystemC<sup>TM</sup> TLM 2.0</a>. The rationals beyond these technical choices are to achieve full system simulation and fast enough simulation to enable debugging software on a virtual platform while maintaining a good representativity of the simulated target.
