		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>
			Instruction set simulators are usefull for processor simulation, either architecture or micro-architecture simulation. Architecture simulation, also called functional simulation, refers to simulation of the processor instruction set, whereas micro-architecture simulation refers to components inside the processor such as pipelines, caches, functional units, branch predictors.
		</p>
		<p>
			Implementing the instruction set into a software instruction set simulator is needed for developping and testing software before the target processor is available or for analyzing softwares without disturbing their execution.
			To go from the instruction set specification to a software implementation of the instruction set, it is convenient to have a description language for easily describing the instruction encoding, but most description languages are restricted to only few syntaxical constructions for describing the instructions behavior.
			Beside, it is important to have a multipurpose instruction decoder as needs evolves.
		</p>
		<p>
			GenISSLib is intended for developping such instruction set simulators.
			It uses a description language for describing instruction encoding. C++ source code blended with the description language allow the use of complex instruction behaviors, or even more functionalities like disassembling, binary translation, system calls translation.
