\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:str7_validation_conclusion}

While the validation of a microprocessor/microcontroller simulator is a difficult, if not impossible, task, it is something that is necessary for its use in an academical or industrial environment.
This document has described the tests performed over the UNISIM STR7 microcontroller simulator.
A special care has been taken on the validation of the main component of the microcontroller, that is, the ARM7TDMI microprocessor, and the microcontroller has been evaluated using a real world application that uses most of its resources.
Multiple simulator errors have been corrected thanks to the performed validation.

While this document is not a prove that the simulator is fault free, it discusses the different validation tests that have been performed to make users confident on the simulator behavior.
