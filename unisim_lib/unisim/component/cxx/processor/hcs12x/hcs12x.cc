		Operation

		Description
		-----------
		Before executing MEM, initialize A, X, and Y. Load A with the current crisp value of a system input
		variable. Load Y with the fuzzy input RAM location where the grade of membership is to be stored.
		Load X with the first address of a 4-byte data structure that describes a trapezoidal membership
	function. The data structure consists of:
		Point_1 — The x-axis starting point for the leading side (at MX)
		Point_2 — The x-axis position of the rightmost point (at MX+1)
		Slope_1 — The slope of the leading side (at MX+2)
		Slope_2—The slope of the trailing side (atMX+3); the right side slopes up and to the left from
		Point_2
		A Slope_1 or Slope_2 value of 0x00 is a special case in which the membership function either starts
		with a grade of 0xFF at input = Point_1, or ends with a grade of 0xFF at input = Point_2 (infinite slope).
		During execution, the value of A remains unchanged. X is incremented by four and Y is incremented
		by one.
