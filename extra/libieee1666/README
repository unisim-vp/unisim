   -------------------------------

libieee1666 supports several coroutine systems for the low level implementation of SystemC coroutines (a.k.a. SC_THREAD and SC_PTHREAD):
 - Boost::Context (fcontext): It provides a sort of cooperative multitasking on a single thread.
 - POSIX.1-2001 ucontext: It provides user-level context switching between multiple threads of control within a process.
 - Windows Fibers: Windows provides native support of fibers, units of execution that must be manually scheduled by the application.
 - POSIX threads

While Windows Fibers and POSIX threads coroutine systems provide stack allocation and overflow protection, Boost::Context (fcontext) or POSIX.1-2001 ucontext coroutine systems do not.
When using the later, libieee1666 allocates coroutine stacks in the heap, and can optionnally protect heap and other stacks from a coroutine stack overflow using a guarded stack.
A guarded stack has one extra mapped page for which any access will result in a page access violation error.

Coroutine system is selectable before program startup by setting the following value into LIBIEEE1666_COROUTINE_SYSTEM environment variable:
 - UCONTEXT for ucontext
 - FCONTEXT for Boost::Context (fcontext)
 - WINDOWS_FIBER for Windows Fiber
 - PTHREAD for POSIX threads

If LIBIEEE1666_COROUTINE_SYSTEM environment variable is not set, the following coroutine systems are selected in order of availability:
 - for Unix:
     1. Boost::Context (fcontext)
     2. ucontext
     3. POSIX threads
 - for Windows:
     1. Boost::Context (fcontext)
     2. Windows Fiber
     3. POSIX threads
 
Stack system is selectable before program startup by setting the following values into LIBIEEE1666_STACK_SYSTEM environment variable:
 - POSIX_GUARDED for a guarded stack on POSIX systems (to be used with Boost::Context and ucontext)
 - WINDOWS_GUARDED for a guarded stack on Windows systems (to be used with Boost::Context)
 - SIMPLE for a simple ungarded stack (to be used with Boost::Context and ucontext)

If LIBIEEE1666_STACK_SYSTEM environment variable is not set, the following stack systems are selected in order of availability:
 - for Unix:
     1. POSIX guarded stack
     2. Simple unguarded stack
 - for Windows:
     1. Windows guarded stack
     2. Simple unguarded stack
