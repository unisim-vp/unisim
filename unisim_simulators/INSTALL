More details on installing these softwares are available at http://unisim.org/site/unisim_simulators/start

2. Building the 'configure' scripts:
------------------------------------

If you downloaded the source code as a tarball, you can ignore this section. If you downloaded the source code with subversion, you first need to build the configure scripts:

$ cd unisim_simulators
$ ./build-configure.sh

In case of failure while running ‘build-configure.sh’, check that ‘find’, ‘autoconf’ and ‘automake’ are correctly installed.

3. Configuring
--------------

$ cd unisim_simulators
$ ./configure --prefix=${HOME}/unisim \
              --with-unisim-lib=${HOME}/unisim \
              --with-systemc=${HOME}/systemc \
              --with-tlm20=${HOME}/TLM-2008-06-09

Script configure also supports the following options:

    * --with-sdl=<path-to-sdl-install>: Override the search path for SDL C headers and libraries
    * --with-boost=<path-to-boost-install>: Override the search path for boost C++ headers and libraries
    * --with-libxml2=<path-to-libxml2-install>: Override the search path for libxml2 C headers and libraries
    * --with-zlib=<path-to-zlib-install>: Override the search path for zlib C headers and libraries
    * --with-readline=<path-to-readline-install>: Override the search path for readline C headers and libraries
    * --with-systemc=<path-to-systemc-install>: Override the search path for SystemC C++ headers and library. Depending on you host machine, script configure will search for library libsystemc.a in subdirectory lib-macosx, lib-gccsparcOS5, lib-cygwin, lib-linux, lib-linux64, lib-gcchpux11 (lib-macosx-x86 and lib-mingw32 if you patched your SystemC)
    * --with-tlm20=<path-to-tlm2.0-install>: Override the search path for TLM 2.0 C++ headers.
    * --enable-release: Compile both debug and release versions of the simulators. Debug versions are more verbose than release versions.
    * --disable-<directory>: Disable compilation of a whole subdirectory (e.g. –disable-simulator-tlm-ppcemu prevents configure and make from entering directory tlm/ppcemu)

4. Compiling the source code
----------------------------

$ make

5. Installing the UNISIM Simulators
-----------------------------------

$ make install

Installation tree is the following:

    * bin...................... : All the UNISIM Simulators are there
    * share.................... : Licenses and other documents are there
