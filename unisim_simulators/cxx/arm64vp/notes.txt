#1 Defensive programming
CurrentEL is compared at start to a full 32-bits constant "0x8"; which
shouldn't be done as all bits except 2 and 3 are res0.  

#2 The one shot FUJITSU
FUJITSU errata; tcr_clear_errata_bits - Clear TCR bits that trigger an errata on this CPU

#3 strlen __pi_strlen: business as usual


TODO: check that ext_v8b is back to rejecting a 4 bit
index... (rejection temporarily removed for symmetry)
