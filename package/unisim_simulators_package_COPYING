2.6   License to Marks.

      (a)   OSCI shall retain all right, title and interest in and to the Marks
      worldwide, subject to the limited license granted to Recipient in this
      Section 2.6. OSCI hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, royalty-free,
      limited license to use the Marks solely in connection with its exercise of
      the rights granted pursuant to this Agreement and to indicate that the
      products being marketed by Recipient are compatible with, and meet the
      standards of, the SystemC modeling language. All uses of the Marks shall
      be in accordance with OSCI’s trademark usage policy set forth in Exhibit

      laws or rules of any country or jurisdiction. In its sole discretion, OSCI
      may commence, prosecute or defend any action or claim concerning the
      Marks. OSCI shall have the right to control any such litigation, and
      Recipient shall fully cooperate with OSCI in any such litigation. OSCI shall
      reimburse Recipient for the reasonable costs associated with providing
      such assistance, except to the extent that such costs result from
      Recipient’s breach of this Section 2.6. Recipient shall not commence any
      action regarding the Marks without OSCI’s prior written consent.

      (c)   All goodwill with respect to the Marks shall accrue for the sole
      benefit of OSCI. Recipient shall maintain the quality of any products,
      associated packaging, collateral and marketing materials on which it uses
      any of the Marks in a manner consistent with all terms, conditions and
      requirements set forth in this Section 2.6 and at a level that meets or
      exceeds Recipient’s overall reputation for quality and that is at least
      commensurate with industry standards.

2.7   RECIPIENT UNDERSTANDS THAT ALTHOUGH EACH CONTRIBUTOR
GRANTS THE LICENSES TO ITS CONTRIBUTIONS SET FORTH HEREIN, NO
ASSURANCES ARE PROVIDED BY ANY CONTRIBUTOR THAT THE
CONTRIBUTION ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH THE PROGRAM DOES
NOT INFRINGE THE PATENT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
RIGHTS OF ANY OTHER ENTITY. EACH CONTRIBUTOR DISCLAIMS ANY
LIABILITY TO RECIPIENT FOR CLAIMS BROUGHT BY ANY OTHER ENTITY
BASED ON INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR
OTHERWISE. In addition, as a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure
any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is
Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before Distributing the Program.

3. DESCRIPTION AND DEPOSIT OF CONTRIBUTIONS

3.1   To the extent Recipient wishes to become a Contributor by making a
Contribution, such Contributor shall:

      (a)    (i)   deposit such Contribution in Source Code form at

      statement substantially similar to the following: "The following code is
      derived, directly or indirectly, from the SystemC source code Copyright (c)
      1996-{date here} by all Contributors. All Rights reserved. The contents of
      this file are subject to the restrictions and limitations set forth in the
      SystemC Open Source License Version 2.3 (the "License"). You may not
      use this file except in compliance with such restrictions and limitations.
      You may obtain instructions on how to receive a copy of the License at
      http://www.systemc.org/. Software distributed by Contributors under the
      License is distributed exclusively on an "AS IS" basis, WITHOUT
      WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, either express or implied. See the License
      for the specific language governing rights and limitations under the
      License."; and

      (e)  cause such Contribution to include a text file titled "LEGAL" which
      describes any intellectual property rights of which Contributor is aware that
      it or any third party may hold in the functionality or code of such
      Contribution.

3.2   OSCI or the administrators of the http://www.systemc.org/ web site shall
have the right to authorize removal from such site any Contribution at any time.

4. REQUIREMENTS OF DISTRIBUTION

4.1   A Recipient may choose to Distribute the Program in object code form
under its own license agreement, provided that:

      (a)   Recipient complies with the terms and conditions of this
      Agreement; and

      (b)   the terms and conditions of Recipient's license agreement with its
      licensees:
            i.   effectively disclaim on behalf of all Contributors all
            warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
            warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied
            warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a
            particular purpose;
            ii.  effectively exclude on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
            damages, including, but not limited to, direct, indirect, special,
            incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
            iii. state that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
            are offered by that Recipient alone and not by any other party; and
            iv. state that source code for the Program is available from such
            Recipient, and inform licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
            manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
            exchange.

4.2   If a Recipient chooses to Distribute the Program in source code form then:

      (a)   the Program must be Distributed under this Agreement; and

      (b)   a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
      Program.

4.3   Each Recipient must include the following in a conspicuous location in the

Program so Distributed or transferred:
Copyright (c) 1996-{date here}, by all Contributors. All rights
reserved.

4.4   In addition, each Recipient that creates and Distributes or otherwise

transfers a Modification whether or not such Modification has been deposited
pursuant to Section 3 must identify the originator of such Modification in a
manner that reasonably allows third parties to identify the originator of the
Modification.

5. INDEMNIFICATION

A Recipient who Distributes the Program (a "Distributor") may accept certain
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, a Distributor shall
Distribute the Program in a manner which does not create potential liability for
Contributors. Therefore each Distributor hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs
(collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a
third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or
omissions of such Distributor, including but not limited to the terms and conditions under
which Distributor offered the Program, in connection with its Distribution of the Program.
The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any
actual or alleged intellectual property infringement of the Program. In order to qualify,
an Indemnified Contributor must: (a) promptly notify the Distributor in writing of such
claim, and (b) allow the Distributor to control, and cooperate with the Distributor in, the
defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
participate in the defense of any such claim at its own expense.
For example, a Recipient might include the Program in a commercial product offering,
Product X. That Recipient is then a Distributor. If that Distributor then makes
performance claims, or offers warranties, support, or indemnity or any other license
terms related to Product X, those performance claims, offers and other terms are such
Distributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Distributor would have to
defend claims against the Contributors related to those performance claims, offers, and
other terms, and if a court requires any Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
Distributor must pay those damages.

6.  NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
PROVIDED EXCLUSIVELY ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. EACH RECIPIENT IS
SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF ITS USE AND
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM AND ASSUMES ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS
EXERCISE OF RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
THE RISKS AND COSTS OF PROGRAM ERRORS, COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE
LAWS, DAMAGE TO OR LOSS OF DATA, PROGRAMS OR EQUIPMENT, AND
UNAVAILABILITY OR INTERRUPTION OF OPERATIONS. THIS DISCLAIMER OR
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT. NO USE OF
